- A Pulley is a wheel on a shaft that can move a belt along it's circumference.
- Pulleys can be used to lift loads and transmit motion.

- We can use pulleys to increase or decrease the speed of rotary motion.
- Look at the diagram below
[[https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/97fe6399a4d793223ee9826adee2b5017e17d385.gif]]
- The =driver= pulley has a diameter of 40mm and revolves at 100 revolutions per minute (=rpm=).
- The =driven= pulley has a diameter of 120mm
- If we want to calculate the rpm of the driven pulley, we first need to find out the =velocity ratio=.
#+begin_html
<math>
<mi>velocity ratio</mi>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mi>diameter of driven pulley</mi>
<mi>diameter of driver pulley</mi>
</mfrac>
</math>
#+end_html
- So in this case we can see that...
#+begin_html
<math>
<mi>velocity ratio</mi>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mn>120</mn>
<mn>40</mn>
</mfrac>
<mo>=</mo>
<mn>3</mn>
</math>

- The output speed of a pulley system is calculated as follows.
#+begin_html
<math>
<mi>output speed</mi>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mi>input speed</mi>
<mi>velocity ratio</mi>
</mfrac>
</math>
#+end_html
- So in this case we can see that
#+begin_html
<math>
<mi>output speed</mi>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mi>100</mi>
<mi>3</mi>
</mfrac>
<mo>=</mo>
<mn>33.3</mn>
</math>
#+end_html
- So the driven pulley will rotate at 33.3rpm.

- For each of the problems below - draw a diagram of the pulleys described and then calculate the answer.
  1. A driver pulley has a diameter of 200mm and rotates with a speed of 60rpm. Calculate the speed of a driven pulley with a diameter of 50mm.
  2. A driver pulley has a diameter of 80mm and rotates with a speed of 250rpm. Calculate the speed of a driven pulley with a diameter of 400mm.
  3. A driver pulley has a diameter of 100mm and rotates with a speed of 50rpm. Calculate the required diameter of a driven pulley if we want it to rotate at 125rpm.
  4. We have a driver pulley with a diameter of 60mm. And a driven pulley with a diameter of 20mm. What speed will the driver pulley need if the driven pulley must rotate at a speed of 90rpm?
  5. A driven pulley has a diameter of 10mm and must rotate at a speed of 100rpm. What diameter will the driver pulley need if it can only rotate at 25rpm?

- Use the Wacano sets to put together the following mechanisms
  1. A 1:2 pulley ratio
  2. A 2:3 pulley ratio
  3. A 1:1 pulley ratio that reverses the direction of rotation

- We can also use Pulley Systems to lift loads.
- Look at the video below and set up the same pulley system with your Wacano set.
- What is the relationship between the length of string you pull through the top pulley, and the height the second pulley moves?
- Does this ratio alter if you use different sized pulleys?
